### 🕹️ The Game
**CoinHeist** is a fast-paced, competitive race where two players battle to collect 10 coins before time runs out. Developed as a team project with three fellow developers, this game was built to run natively on original NES hardware and the **Mesen** emulator.

### 🛠️ My Contributions
In this project, I focused on the visual pipeline and core movement mechanics:
* **Graphics & Implementation:** Designed and implemented the 8-bit sprite assets and background tiles within the strict NES PPU (Picture Processing Unit) constraints.
* **Dash Mechanic:** Developed the low-level logic for the dash power-up, handling velocity and position updates in Assembly.
* **Animation System:** Managed sprite-flipping and frame-cycling for character movement.
* **Combat Feedback:** Programmed the "Gun Shot" visual indicators to provide immediate player feedback during sabotages.

### ✨ Power-Up System
Strategy is key to winning the heist. Players can utilize:
* **Sabotage:** Use the **Gun** or **Bomb** to get your opponent temporary out of the game.
* **Agility:** Use the **Dash** to outrun the competition & Use **Phase** to pass through obstacles or avoid attacks..
