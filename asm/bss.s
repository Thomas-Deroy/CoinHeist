;; COLLISION SYSTEM
; aabb collision buffers based on size. 2 bytes per box: topleft x, y
; Each buffer has 1 extra byte at the front that holds the number of actual colliders that currently exist in the buffer
collision_aabb_2x2: .res 13 ; Max 6 boxes 
collision_aabb_2x3: .res 9  ; Max 4 boxes
collision_aabb_3x3: .res 7  ; Max 3 boxes
collision_aabb_9x2: .res 9  ; Max 4 boxes

;; GAMEPLAY OBJECTS (PICKUPS)   
list_pickup: .res 10 ; 0th element for how many are active, max 3 coins: 1th for x, 2st for y, 3nd for type, then next coin...
pickup_timer: .res 1 ; A frame-wise timer that determines when new pickups should spawn

;; GRAPHICS BUFFERS
clock_draw_buffer: .res 16  ; Buffer for rendering the timer digits.
laser_buffer:      .res 32  ; Stores background tiles, used to restore the map after the laser vanishes.
explosion_buffer:  .res 32  ; Stores background tiles, used to restore the map after the explosion flash.
